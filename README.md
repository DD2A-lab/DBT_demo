Dedicated Industry Expert with a Proven Track Record. I mix a potent combination of analytics with a generous splash of creative juices and blend in technology-focused & data-driven decisions for customised solutions adapted to your needs. I've helped build some of the most forward-thinking brand analytics in places like Inmarsat (Viasat), Microsoft, MATCHESFASHION and MediaCom. Depending on the company's needs, I offer solutions to optimise business performance.

## DBT_demo

Using fake dataset from dbt_fake and shared updates from https://github.com/leogodin217/dbt-fake I demonstrate different elements of DBT.

### Including:

- Models: staging, intermiediate and marts
- Models: (ephemeral, views, incremental)
- Tests: build-in (unique, not_null, references, accepted_values), dbt_utils (unique_combination_of_columns, expression_is_true, ), expectations (expect_column_values_to_be_between) as well as generic and single use
- Properly setup sources.yml, dbt_project.yml, profiles.yml, models.yml
- Use of jinjas and macros.
